Welcome! We are still at the start of the project, so this site will be updated as we progress... 


# What is the AutoCHERIüçí project?

This project has three main goals:

1. Demonstrate CHERI technology for cyber critical and safety critical applications by: 
     developing a TCU based on Morello architecture for each use case, and
     Measure the security / safety / performance trade-offs and the impact of CHERI
1. Assess go-to-market routes for CHERI based products in automotive
1. Explore how this ties in with the emerging, global vehicle cyber security regulations

The performance-vs-security trade-off manifests differently depending on the workload being processed by the system. A large part of the project is focussed on analysing, threat modelling and implementing four specific use cases. 

1. **Vehicle diagnostics data** - Processing data from CAN, through the TCU and up to the cloud.
1. **OTA software update** - Pulling software packages from the cloud, cryptographically verifying them, and passing on other vehicle ECUs.
1. **V2I traffic advisory** - Communicating with roadside infrastructure via cellular-V2X protocols.
1. **Teleoperation** - This is a use case that is safety critical and requires extremely low-latency, so is more impacted by poor performance.


### Consortium Partners

This project is made possible by the cross-sector collaboration of the consortium members:

### What is CHERI?

CHERI stands for **Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions**. CHERI extends conventional hardware Instruction-Set Architectures (ISAs) with new architectural features to enable fine-grained memory protection and highly scalable software compartmentalization. 

* Started in 2010, DARPA (US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency) funded a joint research project of SRI International and the University of Cambridge.
* Over the last decade, many organisations have collaborated on CHERI including: Microsoft, Google and many universities.
* It is a new CPU instruction set architecture that offers two new features: 1) Enforces memory safety of pointers; 2) Introduces compartmentalisation.

**Memory-safe pointers**: The CHERI memory-protection features allow historically memory-unsafe programming languages such as C and C++ to be adapted to provide strong, compatible, and efficient protection against many currently widely exploited vulnerabilities. 

**Compartmentalization**: The CHERI scalable compartmentalization features enable the fine-grained decomposition of operating-system (OS) and application code, to limit the effects of security vulnerabilities in ways that are not supported by current architectures.

### ... and Morello?

Morello is Arm's implementation of CHERI on Arm v8.2 architecture.
It is a development board, compiler & toolchain to allow us to write programs and run them leveraging CHERI

So for our project, Morello is the platform to prove the efficacy of CHERI in automotive domain.
