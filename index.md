Welcome! We are still at the start of the project, so this site will be updated as we progress... 


# What is the AutoCHERIüçí project?

This project has three main goals:

1. Demonstrate CHERI technology for cyber critical and safety critical applications by: 
     developing a TCU based on Morello architecture for each use case, and
     Measure the security / safety / performance trade-offs and the impact of CHERI
1. Assess go-to-market routes for CHERI based products in automotive
1. Explore how this ties in with the emerging, global vehicle cyber security regulations

The performance-vs-security trade-off manifests different depending on the workload being processed by the system. A large part of the project is focussed on analysing, threat modelling and implementing four specific use cases. 

1. **Vehicle diagnostics data** - Processing data from CAN, through the TCU and up to the cloud.
1. **OTA software update** - Pulling software packages from the cloud, cryptographically verifying them, and passing on other vehicle ECUs.
1. **V2I traffic advisory** - Communicating with roadside infrastructure via cellular-V2X protocols.
1. **Teleoperation** - This is a use case that is safety critical and requires extremely low-latency, so is more impacted by poor performance.


### Consortium Partners

This project is made possible by the cross-sector collaboration of the consortium members:

1. **Applus IDIADA** - Systems engineering, validation and regulatory analysis
1. **Beam Connectivity** - Project lead, implementation and test of CHERI based telematics system
1. **CSA Catapult** - Industry stakeholder engagement and market analysis
1. **University of Exeter** - Software engineering support for CHERI
1. **Swansea University** - Cyber security analysis and threat modelling

### What is CHERI?

CHERI stands for ‚ÄúCapability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions‚Äù. 

* Started in 2013, DARPA (US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency) funded research by University of Cambridge.
* Over the last decade, many organisations have collaborated on CHERI including: Microsoft, Google and many universities.
* It is a new CPU instruction set architecture that offers two new features:
    * Enforces memory safety of pointers
    * Introduces ‚ÄòCapabilities‚Äô to limit access to memory that was not expected by the original developers.

### ... and Morello?

Morello is Arm's implementation of CHERI on Arm v8.2 architecture.
It is a development board, compiler & toolchain to allow us to write programs and run them leveraging CHERI

So for our project, Morello is the platform to prove the efficacy of CHERI in automotive domain.
