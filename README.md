# Run it

Follow the steps: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/

or if all pre-reqs are installed, simply: 

1. `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`

2. Browse to http://localhost:4000


# Troubleshooting

### "no acceptor (port is in use or requires root privileges)"

Sometimes you may get the following when starting serve: `Error:  no acceptor (port is in use or requires root privileges)`. This means that jekyll process is already running, using the port. Kill it with:

`ps aux | grep jekyll | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9`


### “The GitHub API credentials you provided aren’t valid.”

When trying to run jekyll serve you may see this error.

This can be due to having 2-factor authentication set up on github, or the credentials not stored otherwise. The easiest fix for this is to generate a unique Personal Access token through github’s website, and store that in the JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable.
